# netCache
netCache is a simple, dependency injection friendly and persistant cache storage library.

## Design goals
netCache is designed to be a simple and fast library that provides an almost silver-bullet solution with caching and persistance for .NET applications. I've designed the library to be functional for ASP.NET Core and desktop applications.

## Notice
This library is currently a work-in-progress
